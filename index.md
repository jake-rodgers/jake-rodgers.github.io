# Hey! I'm Jake

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Physics at Oregon State Univeristy. I am in the Physics Education Research Group at Oregon State and I am interested in 
student retention in physics. Before Oregon State, I earned my B.A. in Physics with a minor in Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering from Michigan State University.

Thanks for stopping by!
