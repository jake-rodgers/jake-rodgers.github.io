Welcome to the more in-depth “about me” post (see the home page for the short story)!
As seen on the home page, I am currently a graduate student at [Oregon State University](https://physics.oregonstate.edu/), after completing my undergraduate degree at 
[Michigan State University](https://pa.msu.edu/). 


I was born and raised in Michigan, and currently live in Corvallis, Oregon. 

I am the middle child of a wonderfully excitable family, which includes my older brother, younger sister, and our crazy dog, Doogie. I have been incredibly lucky to have friends and family who have shaped me in more ways than I can count. I undoubtedly wouldn’t be the person I am today without them—most (if not all) of my growth and character can be traced back to their support, encouragement, and the way they always help keep me centered on what really matters.

Sports have been a big part of my life. Soccer is my number one (and always will be), and I’m doing my best to stay active as life gets busier.

In the long run, I hope to be an educator—someone students can rely on, connect with, and look up to in more than just the context of physics. I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have amazing teachers, coaches, and mentors who’ve been essential to my personal and professional growth. And I can only hope to one day pay that forward.


Now you know a little more about me…sorry!
