### Modeling Pathways Through the Physics Major at Oregon State *[March 2025 — Present]*  
Conducted quantitative analysis of student enrollment and performance data to represent pathways through the physics major at
Oregon State University, which features a unique upper‐division curriculum: Paradigms in Physics. Focused on identifying common
course sequences, dropout points, and retake patterns to inform curriculum development and student support strategies.

### Cataloging Engagement In Computational Practices In A High School Physics Classroom *[September 2022 — August 2024]*  
This poster looks into the individual and normative identities present in this classroom through a qualitative approach, a card sort interview. 
Through this interview, we explored insights into how the students perceive and interact with computation, as well as the practices employed in the classroom. This poster was presented at UURAF 2023 at Michigan State University.

### How do curriculum design decisions influence student expectations around physics and computation in a computation-integrated physics high school classroom? *[March 2022 — September 2022]*  
Using a card sort interview format, we were able to analyze a student's experience to gain insight on how the class is perceived. 
This lead to conclusions like how there are dissonances in the way this teacher taught physics based on the practice they may be trying to teach, and how a student interacts with those dissonances. This poster was presented at a conference in Oslo, Norway, as well as AAPT/PERC 2022.
