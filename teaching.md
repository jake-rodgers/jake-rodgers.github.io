    ## 🧑‍🏫 General Physics (Algebra-Based), Recitation (2024-Current)  
    **Institution:** Oregon State University  
    **Role:** Graduate Teaching Assistant  

    **Key Features:** lecture · life-science-centered · group-based · active learning

    ### Overview
    This class aims to not only teach about the wonders of physics but also build skills essential for any scientist. The learning objectives of the course are centered around problem solving and critical thinking. Students analyze systems using words, diagrams, math, and more to understand the physical world.

    As a recitation TA, I facilitate group work, connect student intuitions to physics concepts, and translate math into digestible language.
