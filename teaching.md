## General Physics (Algebra-Based), Recitation (2024-Current)
**Institution:** Oregon State University  
**Role:** Graduate Teaching Assistant  

**Key Features:** lecture · life-science-centered · group-based · active learning

### Overview
This class aims to not only teach about the wonders of physics but also build skills essential for any scientist. The learning objectives of the course are centered around problem solving and critical thinking. You will learn to analyze systems through different representations that include using words, diagrams, math, and more to draw understanding of the physical world. While physics is not likely your focus, the lessons learned here will change the way you see the world, and ultimately make you a better scientist in your own field. [^1]

In this course, the recitation is another chance for students to practice their physics skills in a group work environment. The job of a recitation TA in the algebra-based sequence is to offer support in group work interactions, connect student intuitions to physics concepts, and to translate math representations into digestible language. 


## Projects and Practices in Physics, Mechanics (2022-2024)
**Institution:** Michigan State University  
**Role:** Undergraduate Learning Assistant  

**Key Features:** modeling · computation · group-based · flipped-classroom · feedback

### Overview
Projects & Practices in Physics is a transformed introductory calculus-based physics course that engages students in scientific practice through the use of modeling projects. Students work in groups to solve complex problems using analytical techniques as well as using [computational modeling software](https://www.vpython.org/). Instructors act as learning facilitators by encouraging students to discuss and debate physics concepts and problems-solving strategies.[^2]

As a learning assistant in this course, you act as the students sole physics facilitator through their exploration of these complex in-class problems. A major responsibility, along with guiding the students in class, is providing weekly feedback to each of your student groups. This feedback often focuses on cultivating more collaborative and effective group environments for student learning.
