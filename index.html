<h1>Hey! I'm Jake</h1>

<p> I am currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://physics.oregonstate.edu/">Physics at Oregon State Univeristy</a>. I am in the <a href="https://osuper.physics.oregonstate.edu/">Physics Education Research Group at Oregon State</a> and I am interested in student retention in physics. Before Oregon State, I earned my B.A. in Physics with a minor in Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering from Michigan State University.</p>

<p> If you'd like to know more about me, see the first blog post! Thanks for stopping by! </p>
