<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> Hey! I am Jake. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Physics at Oregon State Univeristy. I am in the Physics Education Research Group at Oregon State and I am interested in student retention in physics. Before Oregon State, I earned my B.A. in Physics with a minor in Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering from Michigan State University.</p>

<p> Thanks for stopping by! </p>
